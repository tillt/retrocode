File Format Changes (aka simple converting)
-------------------------------------------
Run RetroCode with the input-file-path and the output-file-path, if you 
want to change the format of a sample based ringtone. 

The target format is determined by the given file-extension. That is,
if you plan to create a SMAF ringtone, you will need to supply an 
output-filename with the file-extension MMF (not case sensitive). 

Your commandline should look something like this:
code.exe intput.wav output.mmf

Below are all currently supported encoding file formats and their 
file-extensions.

mmf		Yamaha Synthetic Music Application Format (SMAF/MMF)
swf		MacroMedia Flash (SWF)
rmf		Beatnik Rich Music Format (RMF)
wav		Microsoft Wave
mfm		Panasonic MxxFxxMxx (MFM)
amr		AMR NB
